# Privacy Training Record Tracker

A confidential training management system built on blockchain technology with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for ultimate privacy protection.

## 🔐 Core Concept

**FHE Contract Privacy Training Records - Confidential Training Tracking**

This system leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure that sensitive training completion data remains encrypted even while being processed on-chain. Traditional blockchain solutions expose all data publicly, but our FHE-powered approach enables computations on encrypted data without ever revealing the underlying information.

### Key Features

- **🔒 Complete Privacy**: Training completion status and certification data are encrypted using FHE
- **🌐 Decentralized**: Built on Ethereum Sepolia testnet with smart contract automation
- **👥 Multi-Role System**: Support for administrators, trainers, and employees
- **📊 Real-time Tracking**: Live dashboard for monitoring training progress
- **🔍 Selective Disclosure**: Only authorized parties can access specific training records
- **⚡ Automated Compliance**: Smart contracts handle training expiration and renewal tracking

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Corporate Training Management**: Track employee compliance training while maintaining privacy
- **Healthcare Certification**: Manage medical staff training records with HIPAA-level privacy
- **Educational Institutions**: Monitor student progress without exposing individual performance
- **Government Compliance**: Ensure regulatory training completion with auditable privacy
